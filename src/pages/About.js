              I'm a Software Engineer with hands-on experience who’s inspired by
              solving complex challenges and eager to learn more.<br></br>I strive to
              create results that will generate positive outcomes for individuals
              and businesses alike. As an organized and determined team player
              that doesn’t fight to outshine everyone.
              I put my energy into
              collaboration and working jointly to bring the project seamlessly to
              fruition. As a former accounting clerk I put forward administrative
              skills that result in a more compact outcome for my software
              engineering projects.
              My commitment to collaboration and attention
              to detail ensure my internal code and user facing product are
              equally enjoyable to interact with!</p>
